I've been tweeting about Ishiguro's Nobel since it happened. I can't claim to have figured out its significance yet, but I tend to agree with Sarah Brouillette's position. She writes: "These choices [of Dylan in 2016 and Ishiguro in 2017] perhaps signal a certain awareness of the contraction of the high-cultural field. To select more obscure and difficult writer would at this moment signal an unpalatable irrelevance and elitism." Her blog post is at [this link.](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3430-tragedy-mistaken-for-management-theory-on-kazuo-ishiguro-and-the-nobel-prize-in-literature)
