I'm happy to be launching a blog as part of my online portfolio! 

Please forgive the look of this blog while it is under construction. In order to meet my need for a personal website, I've opted to teach myself HTML and CSS; the benefit is the utter satisfaction I feel at having built this from the ground up. The cost is not being able to center this paragraph. 

Update: no luck yet!
