     <p2 align="justify"> This course teaches writing by interrogating the relationship between race and digital technology. We will learn about "rhetorical techniques," "audience," and "argument" by studying how people of color have used technology to represent themselves. Students will study phenomena such as Black Lives Matter, afrofuturism and "Twitter revolutions."</p2>
