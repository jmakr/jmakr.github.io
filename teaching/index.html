    <h3>Courses Prepared to Teach</h3>
  
    <p2 align="justify"> <u>The Global Novel</u> (Second-year literature course, taught with lecture and tutorial):</p2>
    <p2 align="justify"> In recent years, we’ve witnessed the rise of a new genre. Something more than
postcolonial fiction, “the global novel” has been characterized as a type of transnational
literature that is linguistically simple but narratively complex. Global novelists construct
narratives in anticipation of a transnational audience. They erase marks of regionalism,
writing to increase the ease comprehension for a culturally-distant reader. They license
translations at the same time that they publish originals; indeed, some global novels
appear first in translation, and later in the language in which they were composed.
This course introduces students to the complexity of contemporary transnational
literature, a canon that eschews modernist obstructionism in favor of ease and access. We
grapple with the new standards of literariness set by global novels, which describe
material of intense difficulty in digestible prose. And we attempt to historicize this genre
in the contemporary period, considering the details of digital technology and the global
production network that helped it emerge.</p2>
  
    
    
    <h3>Courses Taught</h3>
  
    <p2 align="justify"> <u>Digital Peripheries</u> (taught as composition course in spring 2017):</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This course teaches writing by having students interrogate the relationship between race and digital technology. We will learn about "rhetorical techniques," "audience," and "argument" by studying how people of color have used technology to represent themselves. The class touches on topics such as Black Lives Matter, afrofuturism and "Twitter revolutions."</p2>
  
  
    <p2 align="justify"> <u>Gender Across New Media</u> (taught as composition course in fall 2016):</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This course will teach the fundamentals of composition, writing convention, and critical thinking by having students explore the representation of women across a variety of digital media. We’ll examine the history of women users of technology, stereotypes of women and technology, and texts made by women. Our investigation into these topics will equip you to better reflect on the relationship between a writer’s representational choices and the conveyed meaning.</p2>
