     <p2 align="justify"> Digital Peripheries (taught as composition course in spring 2017):</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This course teaches writing by interrogating the relationship between race and digital technology. We will learn about "rhetorical techniques," "audience," and "argument" by studying how people of color have used technology to represent themselves. Students will study phenomena such as Black Lives Matter, afrofuturism and "Twitter revolutions."</p2>
  
  
     <p2 align="justify"> Gender Across New Media (taught as composition course in fall 2016):</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This course will teach the fundamentals of composition, writing convention, and critical thinking by having students explore the representation of women across a variety of digital media. We’ll examine the history of women users of technology, stereotypes of women and technology, and texts made by women. Our investigation into these topics will equip you to better reflect on the relationship between a writer’s representational choices and the conveyed meaning.</p2>
