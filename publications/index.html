     <p2 align="justify"> Abbreviated abstract of "More on the Missing 1/2 Second"</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This review essay compares two early and two recent texts by N. Katherine
Hayles and Mark B.N. Hansen. Considering their recent work in the context of Ruth
Leys’s critique of the turn to affect, I argue that Hayles and Hansen use neuroscientific
conclusions on a “missing ½ second” to propose theories of technology’s impact. These
critics neglect to provide explanations of a social or political kind, a trend that appears to
be related to the lesser importance accorded to intention.</p2>
