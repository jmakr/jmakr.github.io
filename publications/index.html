     <p2 align="justify"> Abbreviated abstract of "More on the Missing 1/2 Second," forthcoming from <i>boundary 2</i></p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> This review essay compares two early and two recent texts by N. Katherine
Hayles and Mark B.N. Hansen. Considering their recent work in the context of Ruth
Leys’s critique of the turn to affect, I argue that Hayles and Hansen use neuroscientific
conclusions on a “missing ½ second” to propose theories of technology’s impact. These
critics neglect to provide explanations of a social or political kind, a trend that appears to
be related to the lesser importance accorded to intention.</p2>
    
    <p2 align="justify"> Abbreviated abstract of "Coetzee Against the Disc," currently under review.</p2>
     <p2 align="justify"> In this essay, I examine the pivotal function performed by digital media in the plot of J.M. Coetzee’s Diary of a Bad Year (2007). I show that this narrative, revolving around the composition and transcription routine of a novelist and his typist, perceives in digital media the potential for the end of the book—or, more accurately, a shift from the national system of copyright protection toward a global system. </p2>
